## :chart:   Project Goals
Codeup staff bring up some questions to the data science team in email, and our goal is to answer the quesions regaring the security of codeup curriculum through anomaly detection and data analysis.

Email:


    Hello,


    I have some questions for you that I need answered before the board meeting Thursday afternoon. My questions are listed below; however, if you discover anything else important that I didn‚Äôt think to ask, please include that as well.

    (Questions are listed in EDA)
    
    Send your email before the due date and time (5:00 PM CST, Thursday 8/23/22) to staff-kalpana@codeup.com (Only one team member should do this on behalf of the whole team).

## Questions
1. **Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program), which lessons are least accessed??**(Luis)

2. **Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?** (Jeremy)

3. **Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?** (Luis)

4. **Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldn‚Äôt be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?**(Meredith)

5. **At some point in 2019, the ability for students and alumni to access both curriculums (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?**(Jeremy)

6. **What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?**(Merdith)

7. **Which lessons are least accessed?** (Luis)

## :placard:    Project Plan
#### :one:   Data Acquisition

<details>
<summary> Gather data from mySQL database</summary>

- Create env.py file to establish connection to mySQL server

- Use **curriculum_log** database in the mySQL server

- Write query to join useful tables:  <u>cohorts, logs</u>
     ```sh
      SELECT 
        date,
        time,
        ip,
        path,
        user_id,
        cohort_id,
        name as cohort_name,
        slack,
        start_date,
        end_date,
        program_id
     FROM
        curriculum_logs.logs
     join
        curriculum_logs.cohorts on cohort_id = id
     ```
</details>

<details>
<summary> acqure.py</summary>

- Create acquire.py and user-defined function `get_data()` to gather data from mySQL
     ```sh
     def get_data():
        if os.path.isfile('curriculum.csv'):
    
            df = pd.read_csv('curriculum.csv', index_col=0)
        
        else:

            df = new_data()

            df.to_csv('curriculum.csv')
        
        return df
    ```
- Import [acquire.py](acquire.py)

- Test acquire function

- Calling the function, and store the table in the form of dataframe
    ```sh
    df = acquire.get_data()
    ```
</details>

#### :two:   Data Preparation

<details>
<summary> Data Cleaning</summary>

- **Missing value**: We only have 1 missing value in this dataset and it's being dropped.
    
- **Data Encoding**: We encoded `program_id` and created new column `program` with program's name corresponding to the id.
    
- Create function `prep_data` to clean and prepare data with steps above
    ```sh
    def prep_data(df):
        df.date = pd.to_datetime(df.date)
        df = df.set_index(df.date)
        df = df.dropna()
        df['program'] = df.program_id.map({1: 'Full Stack PHP', 2: 'Full Stack Java', 3: 'Data Science', 4: 'Front End'})

        return df
    ```
    
- Import [prepare.py](prepare.py)

- Test prepare function

- Call the function, and store the cleaned data in the form of dataframe
</details>

#### :three:   Exploratory Analysis
- Address 6 questions raised in email

- Create visualizations for each question

- Address questions raised in email.
