August 2022

# Project Plan
## Goal
- Address questions raised in email.
    Email to analyst:


    Hello,


    I have some questions for you that I need answered before the board meeting Thursday afternoon. My questions are listed below; however, if you discover anything else important that I didn’t think to ask, please include that as well.

    (Questions are listed in EDA)
- Send your email before the due date and time (5:00 PM CST, Thursday 8/23/22) to staff-kalpana@codeup.com (Only one team member should do this on behalf of the whole team).

- In Google Classroom, submit a link to a final notebook on GitHub that asks and answers questions in detail. Be sure to document the work you do to justify findings. Remember, your stakeholder may need to show your notebook during the board meeting. Try and make it as clear and professional as possible for them.

## Data Acquisition
## EDA
1. **Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program), which lessons are least accessed??**(Luis)

2. **Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?** (Jeremy)

3. **Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?** (Luis)

4. **Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldn’t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?**(Meredith)

5. **At some point in 2019, the ability for students and alumni to access both curriculums (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?**(Jeremy)

6. **What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?**(Merdith)
