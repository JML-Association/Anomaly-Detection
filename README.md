## :chart:   Project Goals
**Codeup** staff bring up some questions to the data science team in email regarding concerns of the curriculum's safety.

Our goal is to answer the quesions and identify users with abnormal activity through anomaly detection and data analysis.

Email:


    Hello,


    I have some questions for you that I need answered before the board meeting Thursday afternoon. My questions are listed below; however, if you discover anything else important that I didn‚Äôt think to ask, please include that as well.

    (Questions are listed in EDA)
    
    Send your email before the due date and time (5:00 PM CST, Thursday 8/23/22) to staff-kalpana@codeup.com (Only one team member should do this on behalf of the whole team).

## üí° Questions
1. **Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program), which lessons are least accessed??**(Luis)

2. **Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?** (Jeremy)

3. **Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?** (Luis)

4. **Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldn‚Äôt be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?**(Meredith)

5. **At some point in 2019, the ability for students and alumni to access both curriculums (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?**(Jeremy)

6. **What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?**(Merdith)

7. **Which lessons are least accessed?** (Luis)

## :placard:    Project Plan
#### :one:   Data Acquisition

<details>
<summary> Gather data from mySQL database</summary>

- Create env.py file to establish connection to mySQL server

- Use **curriculum_log** database in the mySQL server

- Write query to join useful tables:  <u>cohorts, logs</u>
     ```sh
      SELECT 
        date,
        time,
        ip,
        path,
        user_id,
        cohort_id,
        name as cohort_name,
        slack,
        start_date,
        end_date,
        program_id
     FROM
        curriculum_logs.logs
     join
        curriculum_logs.cohorts on cohort_id = id
     ```
</details>

<details>
<summary> acqure.py</summary>

- Create acquire.py and user-defined function `get_data()` to gather data from mySQL
     ```sh
     def get_data():
        if os.path.isfile('curriculum.csv'):
    
            df = pd.read_csv('curriculum.csv', index_col=0)
        
        else:

            df = new_data()

            df.to_csv('curriculum.csv')
        
        return df
    ```
- Import [acquire.py](acquire.py)

- Test acquire function

- Calling the function, and store the table in the form of dataframe
    ```sh
    df = acquire.get_data()
    ```
</details>

#### :two:   Data Preparation

<details>
<summary> Data Cleaning</summary>

- **Missing value**: We only have 1 missing value in this dataset and it's being dropped.
    
- **Data Encoding**: We encoded `program_id` and created new column `program` with program's name corresponding to the id.
    
- Create function `prep_data` to clean and prepare data with steps above
    ```sh
    def prep_data(df):
        df.date = pd.to_datetime(df.date)
        df = df.set_index(df.date)
        df = df.dropna()
        df['program'] = df.program_id.map({1: 'Full Stack PHP', 2: 'Full Stack Java', 3: 'Data Science', 4: 'Front End'})

        return df
    ```
    
- Import [prepare.py](prepare.py)

- Test prepare function

- Call the function, and store the cleaned data in the form of dataframe
</details>

#### :three:   Exploratory Analysis
- Address 6 questions raised in email

- Create visualizations for each question

- Address questions raised in email.

## :key:    Key Findings

‚ñ™Ô∏è Data Science cohorts access <span style="color: blue"><b>classification/overview</b></span>  the most. There are 100+ pages that were accessed only once. For example: <span style="color: blue">"Introduction to Python", "Creating Charts", "Case Statements", "ML Methodologies Drawing", "Tidy Data", "git/cli", "mySQL Introduction", etc.</span>

‚ñ™Ô∏è Web Development cohorts access <span style="color: blue"><b>javascript-i</b></span> the most. There are 400+ pages that were accessed only once. For example: <span style="color: blue">"JavaScript Working with Variables", "Java-i", "HTML", "HTML-CSS Introduction", etc.</span>
    
‚ñ™Ô∏è For **Full Stack PHP (Web Development) Program:**

    - cohort 1 looked at jquery much more than other cohorts
    
    - cohort 17 looked at jquery and java-1/methods much more than other cohorts.
    
‚ñ™Ô∏è For **Full Stack Java (Web Development), Data Science, Front End Program:** <span style="color: blue">None of the cohorts looked at a lesson signifcantly more that another cohort just glanced at.</span>
 
‚ñ™Ô∏è <span style="color: blue">4 users hardly ever accessed the curriculum.</span> All 4 users are from **Full Stack Java (Web Development) Program**. Their information are provided above.

‚ñ™Ô∏è There are <span style="color: blue">29 users have suspicious activities</span>, among those users we suspect 2 of them perform web-scrapping and 3 appear to be accessing curriculums that they shouldn't access.

‚ñ™Ô∏è There is <span style="color: blue">no suspicious IP address</span>. But for those who have significant amount of IP addresses during their program, their IP address appear to be distributed accross the United States.

‚ñ™Ô∏è 116 users have <span style="color: blue">abnormal amount of log entry</span> (page visit).

‚ñ™Ô∏è **For Data Science Program**: There <span style="color: blue">does not appear to be any access</span> to the Web Dev paths before September 2019, and after December 2019. Which leads us to believe they did not have access during those time periods.

‚ñ™Ô∏è **For Web Development Program**: There <span style="color: blue">appears to be access to the Data Science paths</span> after September 2019. Specifically, from July 2020 to April 2021.

‚ñ™Ô∏è **Most Visited Topics For Full Stack Java Program:**  <span style="color: blue">HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Java, Appendix</span>

‚ñ™Ô∏è **Most Visited Topics For Full Stack PHP Program:**  <span style="color: blue">JavaScript, CSS, Java, Spring, Appendix</span>

‚ñ™Ô∏è **Most Visited Topics For Data Science Program:**  <span style="color: blue">Anomaly Detection, mySQL, Classification, Feature Scaling, AL-ML-DL, SQL Database Design</span>

‚ñ™Ô∏è **Most Visited Topics For Front End Program:**  <span style="color: blue">HTML, CSS, Introduction to HTML-CSS</span>
